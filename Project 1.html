      Watamu is a small town located approximately 105 km north of Mombasa and
      about 15 km south of Malindi on the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya. It lies
      on a small headland, between the Blue Lagoon and Watamu Bay. Its main
      economic activities are tourism and fishing. The town had a population of
      around 30,000 in 2020[1] and it is part of Kilifi County. The shoreline in
      the area features white sand beaches and offshore coral formations
      arranged in different bays and beaches: Garoda Beach, Turtle Bay, Blue
      Lagoon Bay, Watamu Bay, Ocean Breeze, Kanani reef, and Jacaranda beach.
      They are protected as part of the Watamu Marine National Park. The Marine
      Park is considered one of the best snorkeling and diving areas on the
      coast of East Africa.
